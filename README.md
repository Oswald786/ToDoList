# Ethan‚Äôs Code Guild ‚Äì ToDo List Game üéÆ‚úÖ

A **gamified To-Do List application** built with **Micronaut**, **Hibernate/JPA**, and **Oracle Database** (running in Docker).  
This project demonstrates clean architecture with an **Adapter layer**, **REST APIs**, and **SQL-backed persistence**.  

Completing tasks isn‚Äôt just checking boxes ‚Äî you earn **points, levels, and rewards** as part of a productivity game.

## üöÄ Features
- ‚úÖ Manage tasks: create, update, delete
- üéÆ Gamified scoring system with rewards
- üóÑÔ∏è Oracle XE database running locally in Docker
- üîó Hibernate + JPA for object‚Äìrelational mapping
- üåê RESTful APIs (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)
- üß© Adapter layer for database communication

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
- [Java 17+](https://adoptium.net/)  
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (Community works; Ultimate adds DB tools/HTTP client)  
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) + [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)  
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)  
- (Optional) Oracle SQL Developer / IntelliJ Database plugin

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Oswold786/todolist-db.git
cd todolist-db
2. Start the Oracle Database with Docker
bash
Copy code
docker compose up --build -d
This will:

Pull the Oracle Free image

Run a container with the DB exposed on port 1521

Execute the init SQL scripts (/init) to create the schema, user, tables, and seed data

Check logs until DB is ready:

bash
Copy code
docker logs -f oracledb
3. Verify Database Connection
Host: localhost

Port: 1521

Service name: FREEPDB1 (‚ö†Ô∏è not SID XE)

User: ETHAN

Password: Ethan@9901

JDBC URL:

arduino
Copy code
jdbc:oracle:thin:@//localhost:1521/FREEPDB1
4. Run the Micronaut Application
From IntelliJ or terminal:

bash
Copy code
./gradlew run
Backend will run at:
üëâ http://localhost:8080

üìÇ Project Structure
rust
Copy code
/init/                   -> SQL scripts (user, tables, seed data)
/app/                    -> Micronaut application code
docker-compose.yml       -> Oracle XE container config
Dockerfile               -> App container (if needed)
README.md                -> Setup + instructions
üåê REST API Endpoints
List tasks
bash
Copy code
GET http://localhost:8080/api/tasks
Create a task
bash
Copy code
POST http://localhost:8080/api/tasks
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Write README",
  "type": "docs",
  "level": 1,
  "description": "Add setup instructions"
}
Get by ID
bash
Copy code
GET http://localhost:8080/api/tasks/{id}
Update a task
bash
Copy code
PUT http://localhost:8080/api/tasks/{id}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Update README",
  "type": "docs",
  "level": 2,
  "description": "Expanded instructions"
}
Delete a task
bash
Copy code
DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/tasks/{id}
üß™ Testing
Run all tests:

bash
Copy code
./gradlew test
‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
ORA-12505 (SID not registered)
Use service name: FREEPDB1 instead of SID XE.

Invalid credentials
Ensure user ETHAN exists and you‚Äôre not connecting with SYSTEM.

Tables missing
Confirm schema is correct:

sql
Copy code
SELECT SYS_CONTEXT('USERENV','CURRENT_SCHEMA') FROM dual;
Should return ETHAN.

Init scripts didn‚Äôt run
They only run on first container startup. To reset:

bash
Copy code
docker compose down -v
docker compose up --build -d
